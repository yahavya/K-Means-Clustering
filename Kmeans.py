"""
Given a set of N datapoints x1,x2,...,xN ∈ Rd, 
the goal is to group the data into K ∈ N clusters, 
each datapoint is assigned to exactly one cluster 
and the number of clusters K is such that 1 < K < N . 
Each cluster k is represented by its centroid, 
which is the mean μk ∈ Rd of the cluster’s members.
